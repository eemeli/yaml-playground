# Browser Playground for `yaml`

This repository fulfills multiple related needs:

1. Packages the browser build of `yaml` into a minified UMD package `yaml.min.js`.
2. Tests the library in browser environments (provided by [BrowserStack](http://browserstack.com/))
3. Provides an interactive playground for testing and playing with YAML

For the `yaml.min.js` build, this repo is meant to be used as a submodule of [`eemeli/yaml`](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml).
